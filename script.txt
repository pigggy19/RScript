won the GL eight universities it needs to be the same thing in
0:14
in education the old sure can talk doesn't cut it anymore
0:19
the difference between school experiences and university experiences
0:22
I think a mean massive walk past a room where students are you see them
0:26
interacting
0:27
through social media of an opening two screens at once
0:30
also all they've got their refunds on listening to the iPhone
0:33
clearly we can't just assumed a at teaching
0:37
is not going to change it it has to change if we don't count the way we
0:41
teach them
0:42
will never be able to keep up with other universities and really enhance their
0:46
learning and
0:47
enable them to find jobs in the future to competitors will move ahead
0:51
and the restive in education around the world will leave us beyond
0:55
and we want to consider to the forefront in education will just be considered in
0:59
the backwaters
1:00
academics like everybody else are time poor
1:04
we do three jobs we have to teach we have to do research and we have got
1:08
admin I think the teaches
1:11
should be supported teaching should be resource
1:15
but most importantly I think
1:19
T chain should be valued
1:22
more than it is at the moment you need something which recognizes teaching
1:27
on a more mundane level to recognize assembly putting in an effort
1:32
to make a change for teaching what I would like to see
1:35
in Monash is a strong community are it
1:38
innovative she teachers who are engaged
1:41
I think the bennett aging been a leading agenda when it is realized
1:46
is going to say the most innovative way of teaching possible
1:50
if I had to pick one thing have that I really connect with with the
1:54
better taking their learning agenda it's the challenge steps
1:57
and I think it makes it quite real unapproachable for individual papal
2:02
to use thank you don't have to think about changing everything
2:05
that they do all at once we are working towards and
2:09
realizing if the Asian and we are talking about commitment to learning
2:13
teaching
2:14
and we're talking about the XP into the students
2:17
and the job satisfaction about really very good teaching colleague
2:21
we gotta give people the room to be innovative in the way that work space
2:25
for them
2:26
and works based in the context that they disappoint resetting
2:29
my hope is that students will home believe the unit to the teaching
2:34
experience
2:35
feeling more satisfied and I really are finished the semester the unit with
2:40
greater satisfaction
2:41
we are going to allow for variety and we are going to laugh at differences across
2:46
the discipline areas
2:47
we not going to be cookie-cutter we not all dying to be vanilla ice cream
2:52
we're all gonna be great tasting ice cream but we're going to be different
2:55
flavors
2:56
as we move forward there be more options for students
3:00
to accomplish what they want and get what they want
3:03
added a university education much would have actually achieved many of the
3:07
things they despise
3:09
seen despise to become the best university in the asia-pacific
3:12
with %uh got an agenda which could allow us to become dot
3:16
is going to look unique to Alina besties
3:20
and Monache is going to lead the way in this if it's done right
3:24
I hope that by a implementing the better teaching better learning agenda
3:28
we will transform a education at Monash
3:31
and by that I mean just making sure we give an outstanding student learning
3:36
